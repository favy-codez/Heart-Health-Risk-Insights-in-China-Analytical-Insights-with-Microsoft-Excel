![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/favy-codez/Heart-Health-Risk-Insights-in-China-Analytical-Insights-with-Microsoft-Excel/blob/main/Dashboard.png)

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of heart attack risks across different income levels and regions in China. Using Microsoft Excel, it explores the interplay between socioeconomic status, geographic disparities, and heart health outcomes. The analysis aims to guide public health strategies and inform targeted policy interventions.
---

## Objectives
- Identify how heart attack risks vary across income levels
- Explore geographic patterns in heart attack rates across China
- Understand the role of factors like age, employment status, and healthcare access
- Recommend data-driven strategies for heart disease prevention and public health improvements
---

## Tools Used
**Microsoft Excel** â€” For data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboards, and charts.
---

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**  
   Dataset obtained from Kaggle with records on heart attack risks by income level and location in China.
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Defined key questions and stakeholders (e.g., public health policymakers)
   - Created a pre-analysis board to structure the investigation
3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Created pivot tables to summarize trends by age, income, region, and healthcare access
   - Used slicers to examine subgroup patterns in heart attack risk
   - Focused on both demographic and regional insights
4. **Visualization**  
   - Developed bar, column, and doughnut charts to highlight patterns
   - Built a comprehensive Excel dashboard for intuitive data interpretation
--- 
### Key Insights:
- Highest risk among individuals aged 80â€“89 (16.68%)
- Retired individuals had the highest risk (33.38%)
- Lower activity levels strongly correlated with increased risk
- Poor access linked to higher heart attack incidence
- Western and Eastern regions showed highest rates (~20%)
- High-income earners had the highest risk (33.50%) â€” possibly due to stress or lifestyle factors
- Guangdong (12.61%), Beijing (12.57%), and Shandong (12.55%) had the highest rates
